<h1>My Research Projects</h1>

<p>Information on this webpage is not final. This is a project for my <em>DH Practicum</em> class.</p>

<ul>
<h2>Cuban Literature in the Cultural Magazine <em>Letras Libres</em>. A Work in Progress.</h2>
<p>This project has two main objectives:</p> 
  <p>one) validate the influence of traditional mass media in contemporary society, especially in Latin America, but with emphasis on Mexico</p>
  <p>two) corroborate the importance of text analysis to understand this influence. </p>
</ul>

<ul>
<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Since 1959, cultural criticism made in Spanish-speaking countries has been approaching Cuban literature with a politicized perspective. This perspective recognizes as authentic only certain Cuban literary production. Publishing market, editorials and Cuban critics based outside Cuba, have been playing an important role as mediators of this process. The phenomenon produces and perpetuates a national literary canon divided by politics. Cuba, as an imagined community, has been transforming itself in the last decade thanks to political changes. These changes must have caused consequent changes in the national literary canon.</p>
  </ul>
  
<ul>
<h3>Some research questions</h3>
<p>How does the politization of Cuban literature and the politization of criticism influence in the recognition of certain Cuban literature? 
What are the characteristics of the Cuban contemporary literature which is read by Hispanic critics? </p>
  </ul>
  
<ul>
  <h3>Methods</h3>
<p>Bibliographic sample: Magazine <em>Letras Libres</em>, published in Mexico and Spain from 2006  to 2008.<p>
<p>Text analysis made with AntConc.exe</p>
<p>Data Visualization made with Tableu and Voyant-Tool.org</p>
</ul>
