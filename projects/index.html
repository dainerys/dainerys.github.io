<h1>My Research Projects</h1>

<p>Information on this webpage is not final. This is a project for my <em>DH Practicum</em> class.</p>

<ul>
<h2>Cuban Literature in the Cultural Magazine <em>Letras Libres</em>. A Work in Progress.</h2>
<p>This project has two main objectives:</p> 
  <p>one) validate the influence of traditional mass media in contemporary society, especially in Latin America, but with emphasis on Mexico</p>
  <p>two) corroborate the importance of text analysis to understand this influence. </p>
</ul>

<ul>
<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Since 1959, cultural Hispanic criticism has been approaching to Cuban literature with a profound politicized perspective. This perspective restricts the recognition of a certain area of the national literary production in opposition to another. Publishing market, editorials and Cuban critics emigrated outside the country, have been playing an important role as mediators of this process that produces and perpetuates a national literary canon divided by politics. Cuba, as an imagined community, has been transforming itself in the last decade thanks to political and social changes. Cubaâ€™s transformation has influenced the recognition of certain writers as agents helpful to re configure the national (symbolic) map. However, the politicization of both their literary production and the critical reception of their pieces remains a determining factor in the way in which Hispanic critics identify and characterize Cuban literature today.</p>
  </ul>
  
<ul>
<h3>Some research questions</h3>
<p>How does the politization of Cuban literature and the politization of criticism influence in the recognition of certain Cuban literature? 
What are the characteristics of the Cuban contemporary literature which is read by Hispanic critics? </p>
  </ul>
  
<ul>
  <h3>Methods</h3>
<p>Bibliographical sample: Magazine <em>Letras Libres</em>, published in Mexico and Spain from 2006  to 2008.<p>
<p>Text analysis made with AntConc.exe</p>
<p>Visualization made with Tableu and Voyant.org</p>
</ul>
